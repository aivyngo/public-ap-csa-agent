# 1 Select Focus and Format

**Thought:**
To create a free response question about writing a class in Java, I need to select a specific topic within class writing, such as encapsulation, constructors, or inheritance. I'll choose encapsulation and constructors as the focus for a well-rounded question.

## 1.1 Research FRQ Format

**Thought:**
First, I need to research typical AP CSA free response questions about Java classes to ensure my question is in line with the format and expectations.

**Conclusion:**
I found several resources for AP CSA FRQs and Java class writing, including College Board's official FRQ PDF, Runestone Academy, and CodeHS. I'll use this to ensure my question fits the expected format.

**Conclusion (1)**
To create a valid free response question, I will focus on encapsulation and constructors, as these are fundamental aspects of Java class writing. I'll also ensure the question aligns with the format and expectations of AP CSA FRQs by referencing College Board and other reputable sources.

# 2 Generate FRQ on Java Class

**Thought:**
Now, I need to generate the specific question, ensuring it is clear, concise, and covers both encapsulation and constructors. I will use the generate_question tool for this step.

## 2.1 Verify FRQ Structure

**Thought:**
I should verify that the generated question is appropriate for an AP CSA FRQ and covers the necessary Java concepts. I'll search for College Board FRQ examples to compare the structure and requirements.

**Conclusion:**
The generated question closely matches the structure and requirements of a College Board AP CSA FRQ. It includes a class design with instance variables, a constructor, accessors, mutators, and a toString method, all of which are common in AP CSA FRQs.

**Conclusion (2)**
A suitable free response question about writing a Java class has been generated. The question requires students to design and implement a `Book` class with encapsulation, constructors, accessors, mutators, and a toString method, all of which are appropriate for an AP CSA FRQ.
