The `checkedOut` variable should be initialized to `false`.\n\n3. **Methods**:\n   - `getTitle()`: returns the title of the book.\n   - `getAuthor()`: returns the author of the book.\n   - `getYearPublished()`: returns the year the book was published.\n   - `isCheckedOut()`: returns the current checked out status of the book.\n   - `checkOut()`: sets the `checkedOut` status to `true`.\n   - `returnBook()`: sets the `checkedOut` status to `false`.\n   - `toString()`: returns a string representation of the book in the following format:\n     ```\n     Title: [title], Author: [author], Year Published: [yearPublished], Checked Out: [checkedOut]\n     ```\n\n4. **Additional Method**:\n   - `isClassic()`: returns a boolean indicating if the book is a classic. A book is considered a classic if it was published more than 50 years ago from the current year.\n\nImplement the `Book` class with the above specifications. Ensure that your implementation correctly encapsulates the data and provides access only through the methods specified.",
